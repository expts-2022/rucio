        Before filing your issue, ask yourself:
        - Is this clearly a Rucio defect?
        - Do I have basic ideas about where it goes wrong? (For example, if there are stack traces, are they pointing to one file?)
        - Could it be because of my own mistakes?
        - Does an issue about the bug already exist?
